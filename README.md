# tp-coursepaper
A coursepaper I did in the third semester of studing in NUST MISIS

I learned a basics of back-end development, such as models, repositories, services, controllers and requests handling.
My coursepaper is a simple web site, It allow to upload .csv files with samples of financial transactions and view those transactions. 
You can search through transactions description.
